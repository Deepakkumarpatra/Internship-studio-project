# Vulnerability Assessment Project (Completed)

## Project Description

This project was conducted three years ago with the goal of performing a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of the website [zero.webappsecurity.com](http://zero.webappsecurity.com/) using Netsparker, a web application security scanner. The primary objective was to identify and document all potential vulnerabilities and loopholes that may pose a security risk to the website.

## Methodology

### Tools Used
- [Netsparker](https://www.netsparker.com/): A web application security scanner for automated vulnerability scanning.

### Process
1. Netsparker was configured to scan the target website.
2. A thorough scan of the website, including all its pages and functionalities, was conducted.
3. The scan results were analyzed to identify potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection,and other security issues.
4. All findings were documented, including their severity and recommended actions for mitigation.
5. Collaboration with the website owner or administrator was initiated to address and remediate the identified vulnerabilities.

## Project Status

As a retrospective documentation, it provides insights into the vulnerabilities that were identified at that time.

## Outcomes

The project identified and documented several vulnerabilities on the target website, including Apache http sever. The findings were reported to the website owner or administrator for resolution, and actions were taken to secure the website.

## Disclaimer

- The scanning and assessment of the website were conducted with the sole purpose of identifying security vulnerabilities and assisting in their mitigation.
- The project adhered to ethical hacking and responsible disclosure practices. Any vulnerabilities found were reported to the website owner or administrator for resolution.
- Unauthorized or malicious exploitation of any vulnerabilities is strictly prohibited.
